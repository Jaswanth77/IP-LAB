        <p>The Border–Gavaskar Trophy is a Test cricket series played between India and Australia. It is played via the International Cricket Council's future tours.

         As of February 2023, India retained the trophy after defeating Australia in the first two Tests of the 2023 series. If a series is drawn, the country holding the trophy retains it. The series is named after distinguished former captains, Australia's Allan Border and India's Sunil Gavaskar.
            
        In competition for the trophy since 1996, Indian Sachin Tendulkar has been the most successful batsman, scoring 3262 runs from 65 innings.</p>
